# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on advanced perception and navigation using NVIDIA Isaac tools. You'll learn to use Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated VSLAM, and Nav2 for path planning specifically adapted for bipedal humanoid movement.
