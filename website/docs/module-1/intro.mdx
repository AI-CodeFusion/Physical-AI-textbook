# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications. You'll learn about the fundamental concepts, architecture, and tools that make ROS 2 a powerful framework for robotics development.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Understand the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture",
  "Create and run ROS 2 nodes",
  "Implement communication patterns (publish/subscribe, services)",
  "Connect Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy",
  "Define robot models using URDF format"
]} />

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following parts and chapters:

### Part 1-1: ROS 2 Basics
- **Chapter 1-1-1: Introduction to ROS 2**
  - Lesson 1: History of ROS
  - Lesson 2: ROS 2 Architecture
- **Chapter 1-1-2: ROS 2 Nodes**
  - Lesson 1: ROS 2 Nodes
  - Lesson 2: ROS 2 Topics & Services
- **Chapter 1-1-3: Python Agents with rclpy**
  - Lesson 1: rclpy Python Agents
- **Chapter 1-1-4: URDF for Humanoids**
  - Lesson 1: URDF for Humanoids

## Learning Approach

This module follows a hands-on approach where you'll learn by doing:

1. **Theory**: Each lesson begins with the theoretical concepts
2. **Demonstration**: Code examples and visual aids to illustrate concepts
3. **Practice**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
4. **Assessment**: Knowledge checks to validate understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming skills in Python
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

## Technology Stack

This module uses the following technologies:
- ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
- Python 3.8+
- rclpy client library
- Common ROS 2 tools (ros2 topic, ros2 service, etc.)

## Estimated Duration

This module should take approximately 15-20 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with robotics and ROS.
