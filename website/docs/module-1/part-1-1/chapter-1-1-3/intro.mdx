# Chapter 1-1-3: Python Agents with rclpy

## Overview
This chapter focuses on developing ROS 2 nodes using Python, leveraging the rclpy library. You'll learn how to create Python-based agents that can interact with the ROS 2 ecosystem, making use of Python's simplicity and extensive scientific computing libraries for robotics applications.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Install and configure rclpy for Python development",
  "Create ROS 2 nodes using Python",
  "Implement publishers, subscribers, clients, and servers in Python",
  "Handle parameters and logging in Python nodes"
]} />

## Why Python for ROS 2?

Python is one of the most popular languages in robotics due to its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem of scientific computing libraries. With rclpy, the Python client library for ROS 2, you can:

- Rapidly prototype robotic algorithms
- Integrate with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Leverage scientific computing libraries like NumPy and SciPy
- Develop user interfaces with frameworks like PyQt or Kivy

## rclpy Fundamentals

The rclpy library provides Python bindings for ROS 2, offering:

- Node creation and management
- Publisher and subscriber implementations
- Client and service server functionality
- Parameter handling
- Time and duration utilities
- Logging capabilities

## Chapter Roadmap

In this chapter, you'll explore Python development with ROS 2 through a lesson:

- **Lesson 1**: We'll cover the basics of creating Python agents using rclpy, implementing various communication patterns and best practices.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to develop sophisticated Python-based ROS 2 nodes that integrate seamlessly with other components of your robotic system.

## Next Steps

Continue to Lesson 1 to begin implementing Python agents with rclpy.
