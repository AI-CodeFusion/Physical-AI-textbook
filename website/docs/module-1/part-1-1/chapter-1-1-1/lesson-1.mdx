# History of ROS

## Overview
This lesson covers the evolution of the Robot Operating System from its origins to the current state.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Understand the origins of ROS",
  "Identify key differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2",
  "Recognize the reasons for developing ROS 2"
]} />

## Origins of ROS
ROS (Robot Operating System) was initially developed by Willow Garage in 2007. It started as a research platform designed to provide a common framework for robotics software development. The goal was to create sharable, modular code that could be reused across different robotic platforms.

Initially, ROS was designed to address the problem of every robotics lab developing their own ad-hoc robotics frameworks, which led to poor code reusability and high development costs.

## Evolution to ROS 2
ROS 1 had several limitations that became more apparent as robotics applications expanded:

- Single master architecture that could become a single point of failure
- Limited support for real-time systems
- Centralized system architecture wasn't suitable for distributed systems
- Challenging deployment in production environments
- Licensing issues (GPL v3)

To address these issues, the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) began development of ROS 2 in 2014, officially released in 2015. The new system was built on DDS (Data Distribution Service) to provide:

- Distributed architecture without a single master
- Improved support for real-time systems
- Better security model for production deployment
- Quality of Service (QoS) policies for communication reliability
- Multi-vendor support for DDS implementations

## Key Differences
| ROS 1 | ROS 2 |
|-------|-------|
| Single master architecture | Distributed architecture |
| TCPROS/RosTCPROS | DDS-based communications |
| No built-in security | Security built from the ground up |
| Limited real-time support | Improved real-time support |
| Python 2 & C++03 | Python 3 & C++14 |
| Centralized tools | Distributed tooling |

## Summary
ROS has evolved from a simple research framework to a sophisticated ecosystem supporting everything from academic research to commercial applications. ROS 2 addresses many of the architectural limitations of ROS 1 and provides a foundation for the next generation of robotics applications.
