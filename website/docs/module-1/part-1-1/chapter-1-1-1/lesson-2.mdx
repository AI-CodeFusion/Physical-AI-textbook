# ROS 2 Architecture

## Overview
This lesson covers the fundamental architecture of ROS 2 and its core components.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Understand the distributed architecture of ROS 2",
  "Identify the core components of ROS 2",
  "Explain the role of DDS in ROS 2"
]} />

## Distributed Architecture
Unlike ROS 1's single-master architecture, ROS 2 uses a distributed architecture based on DDS (Data Distribution Service). This eliminates the single point of failure and allows for more robust and scalable robotic systems.

In ROS 2, nodes can discover each other without requiring a central master. This discovery process happens automatically when nodes are started on the same network.

## Core Components

### Nodes
A node is an entity that performs computation. In ROS 2, nodes are implemented as processes that communicate with each other using ROS's publish/subscribe and service/client patterns. Each node runs within a container called a "context" which manages resources like the communication middleware.

### DDS (Data Distribution Service)
DDS is a middleware standard that ROS 2 uses for communication. It provides:

- Data-centric publish/subscribe (DCPS)
- Quality of Service (QoS) policies
- Data distribution across networks
- Language independence
- Vendor neutrality

DDS implementations used by ROS 2 include:
- Fast DDS (eProsima)
- Cyclone DDS (Eclipse)
- RTI Connext DDS
- Gurum DDS

### Communication Patterns
ROS 2 supports several communication patterns:

- **Publish/Subscribe**: One-way data distribution where publishers send data to subscribers
- **Service/Client**: Request/response communication pattern
- **Action**: Goal-based communication with feedback and status

## Quality of Service (QoS)
QoS policies allow fine-tuning of communication behavior:

- **Reliability**: Either "best effort" or "reliable"
- **Durability**: Either "volatile" or "transient local"
- **History**: Either "keep last" or "keep all"
- **Deadline**: Maximum time between data samples
- **Liveliness**: Method for determining node availability

## Client Libraries
ROS 2 provides client libraries for different programming languages:

- **rclcpp**: C++
- **rclpy**: Python
- **rclnodejs**: Node.js
- **rcldotnet**: .NET
- **rclc**: C

## Summary
ROS 2's architecture is fundamentally different from ROS 1, using DDS to provide a distributed, robust communication system. The architecture supports multiple programming languages, provides quality of service controls, and eliminates the single point of failure.
