# Chapter 1-1-2: ROS 2 Nodes

## Overview
This chapter builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in Chapter 1-1-1 and delves deeper into the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2 systems: nodes. You'll learn how to create, configure, and manage ROS 2 nodes - the individual processes that make up a distributed robotic system.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Create and run ROS 2 nodes",
  "Understand the lifecycle of a ROS 2 node",
  "Implement communication patterns using nodes",
  "Configure nodes with parameters and namespaces"

## What Are ROS 2 Nodes?

In ROS 2, a node is an executable that uses ROS 2 client libraries to communicate with other nodes. Nodes are the fundamental units of computation in a ROS 2 system. Each node typically performs a specific function within the larger robotic system, such as controlling a sensor, processing data, or commanding actuators.

Nodes communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, allowing for modular, distributed systems that can scale from simple robots to complex multi-robot applications.

## Node Architecture

Every ROS 2 node contains:

- **Executor**: Manages the execution of callbacks and timers
- **Node Handle**: Provides the interface to the ROS 2 graph
- **Publishers and Subscribers**: For topic-based communication
- **Clients and Servers**: For service-based communication
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be adjusted at runtime
- **Timers**: For periodic execution of functions

## Communication Patterns

ROS 2 supports several communication patterns between nodes:

1. **Topics (Publish/Subscribe)**: Unidirectional data streaming
2. **Services (Request/Response)**: Synchronous request-response communication
3. **Actions**: Asynchronous request-response with feedback and status

## Chapter Roadmap

In this chapter, you'll explore ROS 2 nodes through two lessons:

- **Lesson 1**: We'll focus on creating and running ROS 2 nodes, understanding their basic structure and lifecycle.
- **Lesson 2**: We'll examine ROS 2 communication patterns including topics, services, and the role of nodes in these interactions.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to create functional ROS 2 nodes and implement basic communication patterns between them.

## Next Steps

Continue to Lesson 1 to learn how to create and run your first ROS 2 node.
