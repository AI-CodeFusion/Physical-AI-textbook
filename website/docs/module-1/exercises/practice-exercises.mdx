# ROS 2 Fundamentals Practice Exercises

## Overview
These exercises will help you practice and reinforce your understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Practice creating ROS 2 nodes",
  "Implement communication patterns",
  "Work with custom messages",
  "Debug common ROS 2 issues"
]} />

## Exercise 1: Simple Publisher/Subscriber

### Task
Create two nodes:
1. A publisher node that publishes a counter value every second
2. A subscriber node that receives and prints the counter value

### Requirements
- Publisher should publish to the topic "counter_topic" 
- Message type should be std_msgs/Int64
- Publisher should increment the counter value every second
- Subscriber should print the received value with a timestamp

### Solution Structure
```
exercise_1/
├── publisher.py
├── subscriber.py
└── README.md
```

### Getting Started
```bash
# Create a new ROS 2 package for this exercise
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python exercise_1
cd exercise_1
# Create publisher.py and subscriber.py in the exercise_1/exercise_1 directory
```

## Exercise 2: Custom Message Service

### Task
Create a custom message service that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### Requirements
- Define a custom service message for temperature conversion
- Create a service server that performs the conversion
- Create a client that sends temperature values and receives conversions
- Include proper error handling for invalid inputs

### Solution Structure
```
exercise_2/
├── srv/
│   └── TemperatureConversion.srv
├── server.py
├── client.py
└── README.md
```

## Exercise 3: Simple Action Server

### Task
Create an action server that simulates moving a robot to a goal position.

### Requirements
- Define a custom action for robot movement
- Server should accept goal position (x, y coordinates)
- Simulate movement by updating feedback on progress
- Complete goal with success or failure status
- Client should send goal and handle result

### Solution Structure
```

│   └── MoveRobot.action
├── server.py
├── client.py
└── README.md
```

## Exercise 4: URDF Robot Model

### Task
Create a URDF model for a simple wheeled robot with sensors.

### Requirements
- Define a robot with a chassis and two wheels
- Include a camera sensor mounted on the front
- Define proper joint connections and limits
- Include collision and visual properties
- Test the model in RViz

### Solution Structure
```
exercise_4/
├── urdf/
│   ├── robot.urdf
│   └── materials.xacro
└── README.md
```

## Exercise 5: Python Agent Controller

### Task
Create a Python agent that controls a simulated robot to follow a wall.

### Requirements
- Subscribe to laser scan data
- Implement a wall-following algorithm
- Publish velocity commands to control the robot
- Use the agent to navigate around obstacles
- Test in a Gazebo simulation

### Solution Structure
```

├── agent.py
├── launch/
│   └── agent_launch.py
└── README.md
```

## Hints and Tips

### For Exercise 1
- Use `rclpy.init()` and `rclpy.spin()` for node lifecycle
- Use `create_publisher()` and `create_subscription()` for communication
- Remember to call `rclpy.shutdown()` when done

### For Exercise 2
- Define custom messages in the `srv` directory
- Use `ros2 run` to test your service server and client
- Handle exceptions for invalid inputs

### For Exercise 3
- Use `ros2 action send_goal` to test your action server
- Action messages go in the `action` directory
- Implement proper feedback and result publishing

### For Exercise 4
- Use Xacro to simplify complex URDF models
- Test your model with `check_urdf` command
- Visualize in RViz with the RobotModel plugin

### For Exercise 5
- Use appropriate QoS profiles for sensor data
- Implement proper control loops with reasonable timing
- Test your agent in simulation before deployment

## Next Steps
After completing these exercises, review the concepts and try creating your own ROS 2 applications. Consider combining multiple concepts from different exercises to create more complex systems.
