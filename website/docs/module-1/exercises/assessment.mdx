# ROS 2 Fundamentals Assessment

## Overview
Test your understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals with this comprehensive assessment.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Demonstrate knowledge of ROS 2 architecture",
  "Understand communication patterns in ROS 2",
  "Apply concepts to practical scenarios",
  "Identify appropriate use cases for different patterns"
]} />

## Question 1
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="What does DDS stand for in the context of ROS 2?"
  options={[
    "Distributed Development System",
    "Data Distribution Service", 
    "Dynamic Discovery System",
    "Direct Data Sharing"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="DDS stands for Data Distribution Service, which is the middleware standard that ROS 2 uses for communication."
/>

## Question 2
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="Which client library is used for Python in ROS 2?"
  options={[
    "rospy",
    "rclpy", 
    "rclcpp",
    "pyros"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="rclpy is the official Python client library for ROS 2."
/>

## Question 3
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="When would you use a ROS 2 service instead of a topic?"
  options={[
    "To broadcast sensor data to multiple nodes",
    "To request a specific action and receive a response", 
    "To continuously stream camera data",
    "To store persistent configuration parameters"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="Services are used for request/reply communication patterns when you need a specific action to be performed and a response returned."
/>

## Question 4
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="What is the primary advantage of ROS 2's distributed architecture over ROS 1's single-master architecture?"
  options={[
    "Faster message passing",
    "Lower memory usage", 
    "Elimination of single point of failure",
    "Better visualization tools"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="ROS 2's distributed architecture eliminates the single point of failure that existed in ROS 1's master-based system, making it more robust."
/>

## Question 5
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="Which URDF joint type would be most appropriate for a robot's elbow?"
  options={[
    "fixed",
    "continuous", 
    "revolute",
    "prismatic"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="A revolute joint allows rotation around a single axis, which is appropriate for an elbow joint that bends in one direction."
/>

## Question 6
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="In QoS (Quality of Service) for ROS 2, what does 'reliability' control?"
  options={[
    "How often messages are sent",
    "Whether messages are guaranteed to be delivered", 
    "The priority level of messages",
    "The size limit of messages"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="Reliability controls whether messages are guaranteed to be delivered. It can be 'reliable' (guaranteed delivery) or 'best effort' (no guarantee)."
/>

## Question 7
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="Which command is used to list all active ROS 2 topics?"
  options={[
    "ros2 node list",
    "ros2 service list", 
    "ros2 topic list",
    "ros2 param list"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="ros2 topic list is the command used to list all active ROS 2 topics in the system."
/>

## Question 8
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="What is the main benefit of using launch files in ROS 2?"
  options={[
    "They improve the performance of nodes",
    "They allow multiple nodes to be started with a single command", 
    "They reduce the memory footprint",
    "They provide better visualization"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="Launch files allow multiple nodes and configurations to be started with a single command, simplifying system startup."
/>

## Question 9
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="Which communication pattern is appropriate for broadcasting real-time sensor data?"
  options={[
    "Services",
    "Actions", 
    "Topics",
    "Parameters"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="Topics are appropriate for broadcasting real-time sensor data since they support the publish/subscribe pattern with multiple potential subscribers."
/>

## Question 10
<AssessmentComponent
  type="multiple-choice"
  question="What is the purpose of the 'tf2' transform library in ROS 2?"
  options={[
    "To create custom messages",
    "To manage communication between nodes", 
    "To handle coordinate frame transformations",
    "To optimize computational performance"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="The 'tf2' library handles coordinate frame transformations, allowing different nodes to share and transform data between different coordinate frames."
/>

## Summary
This assessment covered fundamental concepts of ROS 2 including architecture, communication patterns, URDF, QoS, and tools. Successfully completing these questions demonstrates a solid understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals needed for more advanced robotics applications.
