# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module explores the convergence of large language models and robotics. You'll learn to implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper and cognitive planning that translates natural language commands into robot actions, culminating in the integration of all previous modules in an autonomous humanoid capstone project.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Implement voice-to-action systems using OpenAI Whisper",

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following parts:

### Part 4-1: Voice-to-Action Systems
- **Chapter 4-1-1: OpenAI Whisper Implementation**
  - Lesson 1: Voice Command Processing
  - Lesson 2: Speech-to-Text Integration

### Part 4-2: Cognitive Planning
- **Chapter 4-2-1: Natural Language to ROS Actions**
  - Lesson 1: Cognitive Planning Techniques
  - Lesson 2: Translating Commands to Actions

## Learning Approach

This module follows a hands-on approach where you'll learn by doing:

1. **Theory**: Each lesson begins with the theoretical concepts
2. **Demonstration**: Code examples and visual aids to illustrate concepts
3. **Practice**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
4. **Assessment**: Knowledge checks to validate understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1-3 (ROS 2, Simulation, AI-Perception)
- Understanding of natural language processing concepts
- Experience with deep learning frameworks
- Basic understanding of cognitive architectures

## Technology Stack

This module uses the following technologies:
- OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for cognitive planning
- ROS 2 for action execution
- Python for integration
- Speech and NLP libraries (transformers, etc.)

## Estimated Duration

This module should take approximately 20-25 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with AI and language models.
