# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. This module focuses on digital twin technologies using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction. You'll learn how to build, test, and validate robot behaviors in safe, virtual environments before applying them to physical robots.

<LearningObjectives objectives={[
  "Understand physics simulation in Gazebo",
  "Create realistic environments with accurate physics",
  "Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)",
  "Design high-fidelity rendering in Unity",
  "Build human-robot interaction scenarios"

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following parts:

### Part 2-1: Gazebo Simulation
- **Chapter 2-1-1: Gazebo Physics Simulation**
  - Lesson 1: Physics and Collisions in Gazebo
  - Lesson 2: Sensor Simulation

### Part 2-2: Unity Environment
- **Chapter 2-2-1: Unity for Human-Robot Interaction**
  - Lesson 1: High-fidelity Rendering
  - Lesson 2: Human-Robot Interaction

## Learning Approach

This module follows a hands-on approach where you'll learn by doing:

1. **Theory**: Each lesson begins with the theoretical concepts
2. **Demonstration**: Code examples and visual aids to illustrate concepts
3. **Practice**: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
4. **Assessment**: Knowledge checks to validate understanding

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of physics principles
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts

## Technology Stack

This module uses the following technologies:
- Gazebo 11 or later
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or later
- ROS 2 Gazebo plugins
- Unity Robotics Simulation Package

## Estimated Duration

This module should take approximately 20-25 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with simulation environments.
