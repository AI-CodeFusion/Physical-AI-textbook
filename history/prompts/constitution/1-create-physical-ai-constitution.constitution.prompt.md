# Physical AI Learning Platform Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Embodied Intelligence Foundation
Physical AI education must emphasize embodied cognition and the tight coupling between perception, action, and learning. All theoretical concepts must connect to physical manifestations and real-world applications. Students develop deep understanding by experiencing the interplay between simulation and reality.

### II. Progressive Learning Path
Curriculum follows a structured progression from beginner to advanced skill levels. Each concept builds upon prior knowledge with clear prerequisites. Practical exercises must be accessible to beginners while offering challenges for advanced students. Knowledge scaffolding ensures continuous growth.

### III. Hands-On Implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every learning objective requires hands-on practice. Students must implement, simulate, experiment, and iterate on physical AI concepts. Theory alone is insufficient - practical involvement reinforces understanding and reveals subtle complexities inherent in embodied systems. All chapters mandate practical exercises.

### IV. Simulation-to-Reality Pipeline
Learning materials must bridge simulation and real-world implementation. Students progress from simulated environments to hardware applications following established transfer techniques. Simulation serves as a safe playground while building toward authentic experiences with embodied systems.

### V. Integrated Systems Thinking
Physical AI involves control, perception, learning, and system integration. Curriculum emphasizes the interconnections between these domains rather than treating them as isolated subjects. Students learn to design and evaluate complete embodied systems considering the holistic complexity.

### VI. Assessment Through Application
Evaluation occurs through practical demonstrations rather than traditional testing. Students prove competency by building, debugging, and extending physical AI systems. Assessment measures understanding through implementation, experimentation, and problem-solving in embodied environments.

## Technical Standards

All content must adhere to high-quality educational standards with formal, authoritative language while maintaining accessibility. Documentation uses Docusaurus for consistent presentation across different devices and platforms. Materials are organized in clearly numbered sections with logical progression and cross-references where appropriate.

Content must be concise but comprehensive, providing sufficient detail for implementation without overwhelming students. Educational materials include code examples, simulation environments, hardware interfaces, and debugging strategies to support effective learning.

## Development Workflow

All curriculum content undergoes pedagogical review focusing on clarity, effectiveness, and progression. New content must align with existing chapters and follow established learning pathways. Practical exercises require testing on target hardware platforms to ensure feasibility and educational value.

Quality gates include student feedback integration, performance assessment accuracy, and technical correctness verification. Updates maintain backward compatibility where possible and clearly document changes affecting student progression.
