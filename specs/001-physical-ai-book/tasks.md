## Dependencies

- **Phase 2**: Phase 1 (requires basic project structure)
- **Phase 3 [US1]**: Phase 2 (requires foundational components)
- **Phase 4 [US2]**: Phase 2 (requires foundational components)
- **Phase 5 [US3]**: Phase 2 and Phase 3 (requires foundational components and ROS knowledge)
- **Phase 6 [US4]**: Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4 (requires previous modules)
- **Phase 7 [US5]**: All previous phases (requires all modules)
- **Phase 8**: All previous phases

## Parallel Execution Examples

**For US1 (P1 - Student Learns ROS 2 Fundamentals)**:
- Tasks T017-T025 can be executed in parallel [P] as they create different content files
- Tasks T026-T027 can be implemented in parallel after content structure exists
- Task T028 requires API implementation but can be done alongside content
- Task T029 should be done last to test the completed module

**For US2 (P2 - Student Simulates Robots in Digital Twin Environment)**:
- Tasks T030-T038 can be executed in parallel [P] as they create content for different parts/chapters
- Tasks T039-T040 can run in parallel to create simulation components
- Tasks T041-T042 can be done in parallel for exercises and assessments
- Task T043 requires API implementation but can be done alongside content
- Task T044 should be done last to test the completed module

## Implementation Strategy

This implementation follows an MVP-first approach where the most critical components are developed first, allowing for early testing and validation:

1. **MVP Scope (Phase 1-3)**: Complete the ROS 2 fundamentals module (US1) with basic UI, content structure, and assessment capabilities. This provides a working textbook module that can be tested with students.

2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each subsequent user story builds on the previous one, expanding capabilities while maintaining a working product after each phase.

3. **Parallel Development**: Where possible, content creation and component development can happen in parallel across different modules once the foundational architecture is established.

4. **Continuous Testing**: Each module is tested independently before integration with the full textbook system.

## Independent Test Criteria

- **[US1]**: Student can create a simple ROS 2 node that publishes messages to a topic and have another node subscribe to it, demonstrating understanding of the publish/subscribe communication model.

- **[US2]**: Student can create a Gazebo environment with realistic physics and successfully navigate a robot through it using sensor data.

- **[US3]**: Student implements a navigation stack that allows a simulated humanoid robot to navigate through an unknown environment using visual-inertial SLAM.

- **[US4]**: Student demonstrates a system that receives a natural language command like "Clean the room" and converts it into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.

- **[US5]**: Student's humanoid robot successfully completes a multi-step task involving perception, planning, navigation, and manipulation based on voice commands.
